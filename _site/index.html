      <h2><a href="http://blakemasters.com/post/20582845717/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-2-notes-essay">History Matters</a></h2>
      <p><p>Peter Thiel: one should understand some history to get what is going on</p>

<blockquote><p>History is driven by each generation’s experience. We are all born into a particular culture at a particular time. That culture is like an extended dinner conversation; lots of people are talking, some lightly, some angrily, some loudly, some in whispers. As soon as you’re able, you listen in. You try to figure out what that conversation is about. Why are people happy? Why are they upset? Sometimes it’s hard to figure out.
History is a strange thing in that it often turns out to be quite different than what people who lived through it thought it was. Even technology entrepreneurs of the ‘90s might have trouble piecing together that decade’s events. And even if we look back at what actually happened, it’s not easy to know why things happened as they did. All that’s clear is that the ‘90s powerfully shaped the current landscape. So it’s important to get as good a grasp on them as possible.</p></blockquote>

      <p><p>Michael Nielsen on how to act upon knowledge :</p>

<blockquote><p>the core issue here isn&rsquo;t just to learn a set of facts. It&rsquo;s at least as  important to replace your old instinctive habits of thought with new habits of thought.
A conventional response to all this is to shrug our shoulders and say that some people are &ldquo;smart&rdquo;, meaning that they have strategies to convert knowledge of the facts into a change in their habits of thought, and that other people are &ldquo;not so smart&rdquo;, meaning that they don&rsquo;t apply such strategies. I believe this is wrong, I believe we can and should improve our explanations to help people change their habits of thought.
We can do this by not just providing the facts, but by also directly cueing changes in people&rsquo;s habits of thought. One simple idea for how to do this is to dramatize as vividly as possible the point at which an interruption in our thinking should occur. It&rsquo;s that moment which we want people to recognize and act on, as it occurs.</p></blockquote>
