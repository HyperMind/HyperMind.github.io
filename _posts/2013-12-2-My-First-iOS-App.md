title: Debuting my First iOS App?
summary: Excited about my new iPad, I made this app for browsing Python popular libraries and frameworks offline and in a searchable manner. it is universal app for iPhone and iPad

It was really a long journey to program this app given that I did it as a side project.

in a nutshell PyDocs helps you read Python documentation on-the-go. you can browse and search the reference completely offline. It includes Docs for Python and common used 3rd party libraries.

Python 2.7 , Python 3.3, Django , Flask , Numpy , Scipy ,Sickit-learn, Pandas
